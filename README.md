# PenguinMazeWinForms

This was my third semester final project.
With Windows Forms and C#, I created four mazes where you control the penguin and need to reach the igloo on the other side of the maze.

Every time the player moves, they lose energy. If they reach 0 energy, they lose the game.
Predators and food are randomly spawned in the maze when it is loaded. Food gives energy and predators remove energy.

The player can use a limited amount of hammers(spacebar) to break walls.

If the player clicks on the "Hint" button, a red line will appear to show the shortest path to the end of the maze.
